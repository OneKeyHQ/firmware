# __init__.py A lightweight MessagePack serializer and deserializer module.

# Adapted for MicroPython by Peter Hinch
# Copyright (c) 2021 Peter Hinch Released under the MIT License see LICENSE

# This is a port of the version at
# https://github.com/vsergeev/u-msgpack-python
# refactored to reduce RAM consumption and trimmed to remove functionality
# irrelevant to MicroPython. It is compliant with a subset of the latest
# MessagePack specification at
# https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md
# In particular, it supports the new binary, UTF-8 string, and application ext
# types. It does not support timestamps.

# Principal changes.
# Python2 code removed.
# Compatibility mode removed.
# Timestamps removed.
# Converted to Python package with lazy import to save RAM.
# Provide uasyncio StreamReader support.
# Exported functions now match ujson: dump, dumps, load, loads (only).
# Many functions refactored to save bytes, especially replace function
# dispatch table with code.
# Further refactoring to reduce allocations.
# InvalidString class removed because it is a subclass of a native type.
# Method of detecting platform's float size changed.
# Version reset to (0.1.0).
