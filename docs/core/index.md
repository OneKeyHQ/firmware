# Onekey Core

Onekey Core is the second-gen firmware running on Onekey devices. It currently runs on Onekey Touch only, but it will probably be used on Onekey mini/classic in future as well.

Onekey Core is part of the onekey-firmware monorepo to be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/OneKeyHQ/firmware), in the `core` subdirectory.
